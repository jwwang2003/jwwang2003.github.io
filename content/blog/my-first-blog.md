Hello there! My name is Jimmy~

I am currently in my junior year at Fudan University studying Software Engineering (软件工程).
I am not only interested in SE but also dabbling in hardware electronics. 
Therefore, I also chose to pursue an interdisciplinary in microelectronics or 微电子,
one of the well-known majors of Fudan and so-called "很**卷**的专业" (god help me what have I done to myself T_T).

It is currently midnight and I have a full day of classes tomorrow :(

I thought maybe it is high time I start keeping a regular blog. Let's make this a
last minute new year's (new semester) resolution to keep this blog up to date.

Perhaps a proper self-introduction in order. Later...

Anyways, I guess it's time to hit the sack.

Peace out, {{< line_break >}}
